Basic AIR native extension to SteamWorks API
============================================

It's using appId 480, which is example application from the Steamworks SDK. Somehow is not possible to write to cloud with this appId, but it's working with our real one.
It's everything what we need at this moment, but there are more functions to play with in the SteamWorks SDK. I'm not sure how legal it is to include the Steam libs and headers so these are not included. You can get them at this web https://partner.steamgames.com

Adding support for Steam Workshop

Creating an ANE:
- Build the FRESteamWorks CPP project into FRESteamWorks.dll
- Copy FRESteamWorks.dll to FRESteamWorksLib/bin
- Run compileSWC.bat to create a FRESteamWorksLib.swc file
- Run compileANE.bat to create the FRESteanWorks.ane file from the SWC and DLL.

Using the ANE:
In Flash Develop:
Copy the FRESteamWorks.ane file into you /lib directory
Create a copy of the ane file and name it FRESteamWorksLib.ane.zip, and extract it to a FOLDER called FRESteamWorksLib.ane 
Add the FRESteamWorks.ane file to your project library
